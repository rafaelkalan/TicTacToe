# Tic Tac Toe

## The challenge

We want to play Tic Tac Toe. As we are a remote friendly company, we want to be able to play without distance being a challenge to find the best players in the world ;)

### Tic Tac Toe functionality
The functional requirements that we want for our tic tac toe application are:
  - Create and delete matches -- Working on it
  - Join a match -- Working on it
  - Make moves and alter the game board -- Working on it
  - Identify the winner -- Working on it

## Getting Started

[Install docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Then run
```bash
./setup
```
This will take a few minutes. It will create the containers and setup them for use.

When finished, run the application with:
```bash
./up
```

And the application will be running in [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

**Note:** If the port 8080 is already in use, change the configuration in the docker-compose.yml file. For example, to use the port 9090 instead:
```yaml
ports:
  - 9090:80
``` 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
